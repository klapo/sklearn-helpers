# sklearn-helpers
Helper functions for sklearn models and dimensionality reduction

## NormalizeColumnModality: sklearn-helpers

- Contains the FAMD-like normalize column modality class for handling categorical data in sklearn.

- The column transformer is used currently in a helper function that builds a preprocessing pipeline step for mixed categorical and numerical data.

## Other scripts

These contain just my helper functions for handling sklearn pipelines and results. These are not as well documented.
